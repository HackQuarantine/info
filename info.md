## What is Hack Quarantine?

Hack Quarantine is a global, virtual hackathon dedicated to trying to solve problems related to COVID-19, with hacks aiming to fix everything from healthcare issues, to trying to improve people’s ability to work remotely.

## What is a hackathon / virtual hckathon?

A hackathon is an invention marathon where software developers, innovators, designers, creators and entrepreneurs join forces to solve problems. In a short time, small teams will build something amazing to conquer challenges.

This virtual hackathon works largely the same way as a physical hackathon - just everything is online. We’ll still be running side events, workshops and talks - just you’ll be able to take part from the comfort of your own home! We’ve also got mentors waiting on standby to help with your projects.
